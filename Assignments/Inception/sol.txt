crossorigin
  1. Protects User Data          : CORS prevents malicious scripts from accessing sensitive information stored on a user's browser for one website
                                   (e.g., cookies, local storage) when interacting with a different website.

  2. Prevents Unauthorized Access: It restricts unauthorized requests from one domain to resources on another domain.   
                                 : Ensures websites cannot modify or access data they shouldn't have permission to.

    Explanation:

    Point 1: The integrity code is typically provided by the script provider and is not usually publicized to maintain security.
    Point 2: The browser calculates the hash code of the received script and compares it with the value specified in the integrity attribute.
    Point 3: If the calculated hash matches the specified integrity value, the script is considered safe and won't be blocked by the browser.
